      The stock market is a complex system where shares of publicly-traded
      companies are issued, bought and sold. There are many factors that
      determine whether stock prices rise or fall. The actual price of a stock
      is determined by market activity. When making the decision to buy or sell,
      the investor will often compare a stockâ€™s actual price to its fair value.
